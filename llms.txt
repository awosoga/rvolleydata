# rvolleydata

The goal of `rvolleydata` is to help people access clean and tidy data
from [League One Volleyball Pro (LOVB)](https://www.lovb.com/),
[Athletes Unlimited Pro Volleyball
(AU)](https://auprosports.com/volleyball/), and [Major League Volleyball
(MLV)](https://provolleyball.com/) leagues.

## Installations

You can install the CRAN version of
[**`rvolleydata`**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvolleydata)

```

You can install the development version of rvolleydata from

## Usage

for more information on how to use this library.

## Note

Some Athletes Unlimited (AU) data, such as from exhibition matches
against collegiate teams, is missing. Data from matches played during
the 2021 season are also not included due to incongruent data
structures.
